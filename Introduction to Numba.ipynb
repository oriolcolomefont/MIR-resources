This compilation is done on-the-fly and in-memory.\n","- It accelerates Python code (numerical functions) for both CPU and GPU:\n","   - **Function Compiler**: Numba compiles Python functions, not whole applications or parts of it. It is a Python module meant to improve the performance of functions with the goal of achieving a speed comparable to `C`.\n","   - **Just-in-time**: (Dynamic translation) Numba translates the bytecode (intermediate code more abstract than the machine code) to machine code immediately before its execution to improve the execution speed.\n","   - **Numerically-focused**: Numba is focused on numerical data, such as int, float, complex. \n","   \n","## \u003cfont color='red'\u003eHow Does Numba Work?\u003c/font\u003e\n","\n","- Assume that you have a function `do_math` that is decorated with the Numba `@jit` decorator. \n","- Compilation will be deferred until the first function execution. \n","- Numba will infer the argument types at call time, and generate optimized code based on this information. \n","- Numba will also be able to compile separate specializations depending on the input types. \n","- The diagram below, shows all the steps carried out by Numba to execute `do_math`. \n","\n","![fig_numba](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*S0S4QUjR-BsdTICtT9797Q.png)\n","Image Source: Continuum Analytics\n","\n","- **IR**: Intermediate Representations\n","- **Bytecode Analysis**: Intermediate code more abstract than machine code\n","- **LLVM**: Low Level Virtual Machine, infrastructure to develop compilers\n","- **NVVM**: It is an IR compiler based on LLVM, it is designed to represent GPU kernels\n","\n","## \u003cfont color='red'\u003eNumpy and Numba\u003c/font\u003e\n","- One objective of Numba is having a seamless integration with NumPy. \n","- Numba excels at generating code that executes on top of NumPy arrays.\n","- NumPy support in Numba comes in many forms:\n","    1. Numba understands calls to NumPy ufuncs (universal functions: there are over 60 of them) and is able to generate equivalent native code for many of them.\n","    2. NumPy arrays are directly supported in Numba.\n","    3. Numba is able to generate ufuncs and gufuncs (generalized universal functions). This means that it is possible to implement ufuncs and gufuncs within Python, getting speeds comparable to that of ufuncs/gufuncs implemented in C extension modules using the NumPy C API.\n","

Unnecessarily complex code can cause the Numba compilation to fall back to object code.\n","2. **Look for places in your code where you see processing data in some form of a loop with a known datatype**. Examples would be a for-loop iterating over a list of integers, or an arithmetic computation that processes an array in pure Python.\n","3. **If you’re using NumPy and SciPy, look at computations that can be stacked in a single statement and that are not BLAS or LAPACK functions**. These are prime candidates for using the ufunc optimization capabilities of Numba.\n","4. **Experiment with Numba’s compilation options**.\n","5. **Determine the intended datatype signature of the function and core code**.
