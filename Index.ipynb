    "The MIR course is offered in the second trimester of [Master in Sound and Music Computing](https://www.upf.edu/web/smc) at UPF/Barcelona and assumes the students have already taken the [Audio Signal Processing for Music Applications course](https://www.upf.edu/web/smc/audio-signal-processing-for-music-applications). As some of the brain cells and connections get deleted during the semester break, it is a good idea to consider a few review tasks and warm up for the new content. The following notebooks are prepared to help you warm up. \n",
